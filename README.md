### What is Kraken?
Kraken is a simple WordPress theme built with Foundation 6 base on [JointsWP](http://jointswp.com/)

### Why I named this theme Kraken?
Besouce I like said in every new release of theme: 

> Release the Kraken :D

### What comes with Kraken?
Kraken comes pre-baked with all of the great features that are found in the Foundation framework – simply put, if it works in Foundation, it will work in Kraken. The theme also includes:

- Foundation Navigation Options
- Motion-UI
- Grid archive templates
- Translation Support
- Bower and Gulp Support
- And much, much more!

### What tools do I need to use Kraken?
You can use whatever you want – seriously. While the Sass version comes with Bower and Gulp support out of the box, you aren’t required to use those by any means. You can use CodeKit, Grunt, Compass or nothing at all. It’s completely up to you how you decide to build you theme – Kraken won’t get in the way of your workflow.

### Getting Started With Gulp
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- Using the command line, navigate to your theme directory
- Run npm install
- Run gulp to confirm everything is working
